changes in spatialprobit 0.9-10 (2013-04-28)
# Fixed a bug with the SAR probit total effects (thanks to Virgilio.Gomez@uclm.es)
# Added estimation of SAR ordered probit (sarorderedprobit())

changes in spatialprobit 0.9-9 (2013-06-03)
# Added some checks on the input parameters in sarprobit(). Matrix W must not have non-zeros in the main diagonal.

changes in spatialprobit 0.9-8 (2013-03-01)
# 25% performance optimization in sarprobit()
# Added logLik() function for sarprobit() and semprobit() fit
# Removed dependency on akima package

changes in spatialprobit 0.9-7 (2013-02-15)
# Bugfix in number of rho gridpoints (do_ldet() gives 2000 gridpoints instead of 2001).

changes in spatialprobit 0.9-6 (2013-02-15)
# Added Bayesian estimation of the spatial error probit model (SEM probit; semprobit())
# Added Bayesian estimation of the spatial autoregressive Tobit model (SAR Tobit; sartobit())
# Added LeSagePaceExperiment() function for replication of tables in LeSage and Pace (2009), section 10.1.5
# Added documentation for CKM data set (Coles, Katz, Mendelsohn)
# Added Katrina data set used in LeSage et al. (2011)
# Optimized calculation of tr(W^i) in tracesWi() with significant speed-up
# Better integration with package spdep: use computation methods for log-determinants ln|I_n - rho W| from package spdep too
# Optimized calculation of the average total effects using the QR-decomposition of S=(I_n - rho W)
# Added impacts() function for printing the average total, average direct and average indirect effects
# Use of deprecated {as.,is.,}real() functions replaced by {as.,is.,}double()

changes in spatialprobit 0.9-3 (2012-07-05)
# data set CKM "Innovation among physicians" added (Coles, Katz, Mendelsohn)
# added method marginal.effects()/marginal.effects.sarprobit() for computing average direct, indirect and total impacts.

changes in spatialprobit 0.9-2 (2012-05-21)
# Export c.sarprobit() method for parallelization
# Return value for method summary.sarprobit()

changes in spatialprobit 0.9-1 (2012-02-19)
# first CRAN version
# added method sarprobit() with formula / model.frame support

changes in spatialprobit 0.2 (2012-01-28)
# Added c.sarprobit() method for parallelization
# added showProgress=FALSE as default.
# Added estimation of direct impacts (total impacts and indirect impacts still to do)
# Removed dependency on package "pracma"

changes in spatialprobit 0.1 (2012-01-17)
# Bayesian estimation of the SAR probit model
